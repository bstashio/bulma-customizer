Create your own **bespoke** Bulma build.

[![Bulma Customizer &#8211; Create your own bespoke Bulma build](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bstashio/bulma-customizer/master/assets/images/bulma-customizer-banner.png)](https://bulma-customizer.bstash.io/)

A WIP, PWA, unofficial online build generator of the [Bulma CSS framework](http://bulma.io),
that was inspired by [Bootstrap Customize](https://getbootstrap.com/customize/).

Currently, the code is not ready for public sharing, so this repo will simply 
be used for sharing ideas of how this could be further developed.  It also acts as the go-to place to propose extensions and the like; so if you happen to know one that hasn't been included in [Bulma Customizer](https://bulma-customizer.bstash.io/), feel free to open an issue and provide relevant details.
